Javascript is a vital part of dynamic content on the modern web. From simple scripts to complex interactions that require frameworks, Javascript enhances user experiences on the web.
There are two major types of Javascript, and this Udacity Javascript hub covers both. The first type is “vanilla” Javascript, scripts you can write using the basic rules in the Javascript standard. The second type is framework-driven Javascript that creates complex content building upon others’ frameworks, like Angular and React or libraries like FusionCharts.

This Javascript hub contains easy-to-follow guides on a wide range of Javascript topics. Most articles provide sample code to demonstrate how Javascript works in the real world.

This hub is meant to be a comprehensive resource, so we will add new content as it’s published. Check back here for more Javascript content.
